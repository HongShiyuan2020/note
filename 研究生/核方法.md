You need to answer circuit question by the circuit image in such format: 
Answer: [A|B|C|D] 
Explanation: [some english text to explain the answer in one line]. 

Content: 
B and C are points on the branches connecting two light bulbs, and A is a point on the main line. As shown in the diagram, when exploring the relationships of currents in a parallel circuit, student Xiao Ming used an ammeter to measure the currents at points A, B, and C as IA=0.5 A, IB=0.3 A, IC=0.2 A, respectively. After recording the data in the table, the next step that should first be done is:

A: Tidy up the equipment and end the experiment
B: Use different specifications of light bulbs and measure a few more sets of current values
C: Analyze the data and draw conclusions
D: Switch to another range on the ammeter and measure another set of current values
